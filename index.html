        <h2>Strengths</h2>
    	  <p>
    	     I've been told by many people that I'm an old soul. To some people this may mean that I'm boring, and to others that I'm kind. I've found that I'm a minimalist and that I've never been a needy person, however when I want something I am relentless in the pursuit of it. Whatever it may be, from troubleshooting my computer, to improving my performance at anything that I deem necessary. Through my years of employment I've found that I have a very strong work ethic. I'm willing to do whatever it takes to get the job done.

        <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
        <p>
     	    There are only a few things in my life that I feel should be put under an accomplishments tab of a Resume. One of which is graduating from high school. Another accomplishment that I feel will push me forward and help me to become self motivated is my recent weight loss. I started at 260 pounds close to two years ago now, and am down to 180 pounds. This was the single hardest thing that I have ever attempted and succeeded in, and also the thing in my life I am most proud of. I intend to use the same perseverance and willpower to drive my life to a better place.</p>

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>	I've recently started enjoying hiking and seeing the country a lot more. I hiked up Mt. Massive in Colorado with my dad, and we have started planning a 10 day hike in Switzerland next year. I've always been a computer nerd. Video-games were my first love and I'll always have a soft spot for them.
